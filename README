========================
To run either the builder or the player applications, right click on the Kabasuji-Cebriones project and run as -> Java Application. Then select which launcher you would like to start. 

Quick notes:

The splash screen is commented out at the beginning of the player application. This is for testing purposes. Otherwise, the splash screen launches during every test and the tests take a long time. 
 
 To activate the splash screen, comment lines 54 and 55 in the src/playerBoundary/KabasujiPlayerApplication.java file back in.
 
 A default game is loaded into the player automatically. It contains 15 playable levels, all of which are guaranteed to be winable to at least 2 stars. 
 
 **IMPORTANT**
 Make sure to press enter after added a move number or time constraint into the builder. Because of the way a JTextBox works, the information is only pushed to the controller class when the enter button is hit.
 
 When a tile is removed from the board, it is inserted into the back of the bullpen. Some people thought they disappeared, but this is not the case.
